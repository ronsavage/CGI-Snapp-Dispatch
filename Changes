Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Snapp::Dispatch.

1.04  Tue Aug 20 12:49:00 2013
	- Switch from Test::More.is_deeply() to Test::Deep.cmp_deeply().
		This is to avoid hash key randomization issues.

1.03  Wed Jun 12 09:16:00 2013
	- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.
	- Fix use statement in t/logs.t which referred to CGI::Snapp::RunScript when it should have been
		CGI::Snapp::Dispatch::RunScript. It's under the t/ directory, and so is not installed.
	- Update pre-req to CGI::Snapp V 1.04.

1.02  Sat Nov 17 10:31:00 2012
	- Use File::Spec -> catfile('t', 'x.pl') instead of 't/x.pl' in tests.
	- Update pre-req to CGI::Snapp V 1.03.

1.01  Tue Sep 18 11:23:00 2012
	- Make CGI::Snapp V 1.02 the pre-req, up from V 1.01.
	- Remove CGI::PSGI from the pre-reqs, now that it's properly a pre-req for CGI::Snapp, as it should
		have been all along.
