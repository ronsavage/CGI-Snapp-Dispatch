[V 2.00]
Date=2016-09-04T12:10:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Hash::FieldHash has been replaced by Moo.
By default Moo has no XS. And since Hash::FieldHash had an XS component, this switch to Moo
may help some users there too.
Also note, from the Moo docs: 'If a new enough version of Class::XSAccessor is available,
it will be used ...'.
- Add github repo.
- Adopt new repo structure. This includes changing the licence from Artistic to Perl. See
http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html.
- Adopt patch to t/lib/CGI/Snapp/Dispatch/RunScript from twata. See RT#81241. With thanx.
V 2.00 is being released because this new version of RunScript.pm was inserted into
CGI::Snapp but not into CGI::Snapp::Dispatch at the same time. See RT#118198 and RT#118198.

Comments= <<EOT
- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.
- Fix use statement in t/logs.t which referred to CGI::Snapp::RunScript when it should have been
CGI::Snapp::Dispatch::RunScript. It's under the t/ directory, and so is not installed.
- Update pre-req to CGI::Snapp V 1.04.

Comments= <<EOT
- Make CGI::Snapp V 1.02 the pre-req, up from V 1.01.
- Remove CGI::PSGI from the pre-reqs, now that it's properly a pre-req for CGI::Snapp, as it
should have been all along.
