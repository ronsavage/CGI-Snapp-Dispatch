Comments= <<EOT
- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.
- Fix use statement in t/logs.t which referred to CGI::Snapp::RunScript when it should have been
CGI::Snapp::Dispatch::RunScript. It's under the t/ directory, and so is not installed.

Comments= <<EOT
- Make CGI::Snapp V 1.02 the pre-req, up from V 1.01.

have been all along.
